# Bioinformatics Tools by Rafa≈Ç Woycicki

A collection of interactive web tools for RNA-Seq experiment design and gene structure visualization.

## Available Tools

### [RNA-Seq Power Calculator](https://rafalwoycicki.github.io/power_calculator/index.html)

Plan RNA-Seq experiments using the DESeq2 model.  
Key features:
- Estimate statistical power or required sample size
- Based on Negative Binomial distribution
- Adjust for FDR and desired discovery rank
- Ideal for pilot studies and grant planning


### [Exons Painter](https://rafalwoycicki.github.io/exons_painter/exons.html)

Visualize gene sequences and transcript structures interactively.  
Key features:
- Highlight exons corresponding to selected transcripts
- Explore alternative splicing
- Clean, browser-based interface
- Supports any gene data you provide

---

Both tools are open-source, self-contained, and can be run entirely in the browser without installation.

Feel free to clone or fork this repository to host your own instances or customize the tools for your specific project needs.
