# ðŸ§¬ Gene Exon Painter â€“ User Manual

## Introduction

**Gene Exon Painter** is an interactive web-based tool for visualizing exons from multiple transcripts mapped onto a genomic sequence. It helps you:

- Understand transcript structure and exon organization
- Explore alternative splicing
- Identify shared and overlapping exons
- Demonstrate gene architecture in teaching

---

## Installation & Requirements

- **No installation required** â€“ just open the HTML file in your browser
- Works offline after loading
- Supported browsers:
  - Chrome (recommended)
  - Firefox
  - Edge
  - Safari (limited)

---

## Input Files

### Genomic Sequence

- Format: `.fasta`, `.fa`, or `.txt`
- Must contain one continuous sequence (no line breaks within bases)
- Example:
  ```
  >chr9_mouse
  AGTCGATCGATCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGC...
  ```

### Exon FASTA Files

- Format: `.fasta`, `.fa` (can upload multiple)
- Each entry header should be:
  ```
  >TranscriptID:ExonLabel
  ```
- Sequence must match exactly a region in the genomic sequence
- Example:
  ```
  >ENST00000619216:exon_1
  ATGCGTACTGACGTTAG
  ```

## Step-by-Step Usage

### 1. Load Files

- Upload your **genomic sequence file** using the left panel
- Upload **one or more exon FASTA files**

### 2. Select and View Transcripts

- Choose a transcript from the dropdown
- Exons for that transcript will appear below

### 3. Highlight Exons

- Click exon names in the list or table to highlight their positions
- Multiple exons can be selected
- Overlaps are visualized using color gradients

### 4. View Details

- Click a base in the sequence to open the related exon
- The panel shows:
  - Exon label, position and sequence
  - Exons with identical sequence
  - Exons overlapping the selected one

---

## Features

- Color-coded exon visualization
- Gradients for overlapping regions
- Clickable base-by-base interaction
- Dynamic dropdowns and filtering
- Detection of identical sequences and overlaps

---

## Error Handling

- Exons not found in the genome are skipped (warning in console)
- Genomes over ~500,000 bp may reduce performance

---

## Known Limitations

- No export functionality (planned)
- No strand/directionality support
- Compressed files (`.gz`) not supported

---

## Troubleshooting

### Exons not showing?

- Check if the exon sequence matches the genomic region exactly
- Ensure the genome file was uploaded first

### Colors confusing?

- Each transcript is assigned a unique color
- Overlapping exons show blended gradients
- Hover over bases to see transcript:exon labels

### Sequence loaded but nothing appears?

- Inspect the browser console (F12) for loading errors
- Check if sequences match exactly (including case and characters)
